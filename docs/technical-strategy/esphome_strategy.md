# ESPHome Move/Stop Light Control Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document proposes implementing native "move/stop" light control functionality in ESPHome to align with Zigbee and Matter standards, improve user experience, and enable more intuitive manual light control. The move/stop modality—where users can initiate continuous brightness/color changes and halt them at any point—is a fundamental interaction pattern in modern smart home protocols that ESPHome currently lacks.

## Problem Statement

ESPHome's current light component supports transitions with fixed endpoints but lacks the ability to:
- Start continuous brightness/color adjustments without predetermined targets
- Halt ongoing transitions while preserving the current intermediate state  
- Provide intuitive "hold-and-release" dimming functionality expected by users

This limitation forces users to implement complex workarounds using rapid-fire commands, resulting in poor user experience and increased system overhead.

## Standards Compliance Gap

### Zigbee and Matter Requirements

The move/stop modality is mandated by leading smart home protocols:

- **Zigbee Level Control Cluster**: Defines `Move` and `Stop` commands as core functionality
- **Matter Level Control Cluster**: Implements identical move/stop semantics
- **Commercial Device Expectations**: Users expect ESPHome devices to behave like commercial smart switches that support hold-and-release dimming

### Current Workaround Limitations

Existing approaches to achieve move/stop functionality have significant drawbacks:

1. **Complex YAML Configurations**: Require intricate logic with globals, intervals, and lambda functions
2. **Network Overhead**: Multiple rapid commands create unnecessary traffic and latency
3. **Unreliable Behavior**: Timing-dependent workarounds are prone to edge cases and failures
4. **Poor User Experience**: Jerky, unresponsive dimming compared to commercial devices

## Technical Analysis

### Current ESPHome Architecture

The existing `LightState` class provides:
- `start_transition_()` for predetermined endpoint transitions
- `stop_effect_()` for halting light effects
- No mechanism for continuous adjustment or mid-transition halting

### Implementation Requirements

To support move/stop functionality, ESPHome needs:

1. **Enhanced State Tracking**: Monitor current interpolated values during transitions
2. **Continuous Update Loop**: Support ongoing brightness/color adjustments without fixed endpoints
3. **Immediate Halt Capability**: Stop transitions and preserve current state
4. **Hardware Abstraction**: Consistent behavior across PWM, addressable LEDs, and other light types

### Proposed API Design

```yaml
# New light actions
light.move_brightness:
  id: my_light
  direction: UP  # UP, DOWN, STOP
  speed: 10%_per_second  # optional rate control

light.move_color_temperature:
  id: my_light
  direction: WARMER  # WARMER, COOLER, STOP
  speed: 50K_per_second
```

### Simplified User Configuration

Current complex workaround:
```yaml
# 20+ lines of complex logic with globals and intervals
```

Proposed simple solution:
```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: gpio
    pin: GPIO12
    on_press:
      - light.move_brightness:
          id: my_light
          direction: UP
    on_release:
      - light.move_brightness:
          id: my_light
          direction: STOP
```

## Business Case

### User Experience Benefits

1. **Intuitive Control**: Hold-and-release dimming matches user expectations from commercial devices
2. **Precision**: Users can stop at exact desired brightness levels without predefined steps
3. **Responsiveness**: Local execution eliminates network latency for smooth, immediate adjustments
4. **Accessibility**: Continuous adjustment is easier for users with motor skill limitations

### Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Network Traffic**: Single start/stop commands vs. continuous rapid-fire messages
2. **Lower Home Assistant Load**: Device-local processing reduces server overhead
3. **Improved Reliability**: Eliminates timing-dependent workarounds prone to failure

### Ecosystem Integration

1. **Standards Compliance**: Native support for Zigbee/Matter Level Control Cluster commands
2. **Future-Proofing**: Essential for Matter adoption and interoperability
3. **Developer Experience**: Simplified automation blueprints and configurations

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Core Architecture Changes

The implementation leverages existing ESPHome infrastructure while adding minimal complexity:

1. **Extend LightState Class**:
   - Add `start_move_()` and `stop_move_()` methods
   - Track current interpolated values during continuous adjustments
   - Implement rate-based updates using existing timer mechanisms

2. **New Action Framework**:
   - `MoveAction` class for continuous adjustments
   - Direction and speed parameters
   - Integration with existing hardware abstraction layers

3. **Hardware Compatibility**:
   - Consistent behavior across PWM, addressable LEDs, and other platforms
   - Leverage existing output mechanisms for smooth updates

### Resource Optimization

- **Minimal Memory Overhead**: Reuse existing transition state tracking
- **Efficient Updates**: Rate-limited adjustments to balance smoothness and performance
- **Optional Feature**: Compile-time flags to exclude functionality when not needed

### API Integration Points

1. **YAML Actions**: New `light.move_*` and `light.stop_*` actions
2. **Native API**: Direct C++ calls for custom components
3. **MQTT Integration**: Standard topics for Home Assistant integration
4. **Matter/Zigbee Bridge**: Direct cluster command mapping
