ESPHome is a powerful tool for custom firmware, and its light component offers various features, including transitions. However, the specific feature of **halting a light transition mid-transition and retaining the partially transitioned brightness/color** is not directly supported as a standard action or configuration option.

Here's a breakdown of what I found and what this implies:

**1. Feature Requests:**

* I couldn't find an explicit, widely-voted-on feature request specifically for "halting a light transition mid-transition and retaining the partially transitioned state" on the official ESPHome feature request tracker or common forums.
* The existing `light.turn_on` and `light.turn_off` actions allow specifying a `transition_length`. When a new `turn_on` or `turn_off` command is issued *during* an existing transition, it seems the ongoing transition is typically overridden or immediately jumps to the new target state (or starts a new transition to the new target).
* There are discussions about sensor value filtering and debounce, which touch on the idea of ignoring state changes for a period, but this is different from precisely stopping a light transition and holding its current partial state.

**2. Implemented Work or Discussions:**

* The `LightState` class in ESPHome's API documentation shows internal methods like `start_transition_` and `stop_effect_`. While `stop_effect_` exists for stopping *effects*, there isn't a direct public-facing method or YAML action for stopping an ongoing *transition* and holding its current value.
* The `transition_length` parameter in `light.turn_on` and `light.turn_off` implies a defined start and end point. The system is designed to reach the target over the specified time.
* Discussions around "turn on transitions not working" or "color transitions affected" might indicate some challenges or nuances with how transitions are handled internally, but not directly about pausing them.

**3. Technical Hurdles:**

* **State Management Complexity:** To halt a transition and retain its current state, the light component would need to continuously track the light's *current interpolated value* during the transition, not just its target and start values. When halted, this interpolated value would need to become the new "target" until explicitly changed. This requires more granular internal state management than simply calculating a target and transitioning to it.
* **Interrupting Timers/Animation Loops:** Light transitions are likely implemented using internal timers or animation loops that smoothly adjust the light's parameters over time. Halting this mid-way would require interrupting this ongoing process and then potentially re-initializing it from the current intermediate value if the transition were to resume or change.
* **Hardware Abstraction Layer:** ESPHome abstracts various light hardware (PWM, addressable LEDs like WS2812, etc.). Ensuring that a "halt mid-transition" feature works consistently and smoothly across all supported hardware might present challenges. Some hardware might respond more gracefully to rapid changes in brightness/color commands than others.
* **API Design:** A new action or parameter would be needed to signal a "halt transition" command, possibly with an option to specify whether to retain the current value or jump to a specific intermediate value.

**4. Philosophical or Design Approaches Against Such a Feature:**

* **Simplicity and Determinism:** ESPHome generally aims for simplicity and deterministic behavior through YAML configurations. A "halt mid-transition" feature introduces a level of real-time control and non-determinism that might deviate from this philosophy. The current approach is more "set it and forget it" for transitions.
* **Focus on End State:** The primary focus of light controls in ESPHome (and Home Assistant integrations) is typically on setting a desired *end state* (on/off, brightness, color) and letting the system handle the smooth transition to that state. Interrupting this process might be seen as an edge case or a more advanced behavior that complicates the core design.
* **Resource Usage:** Continuously calculating and storing intermediate transition values, and potentially handling frequent interruptions, could introduce slight overhead in terms of CPU cycles and memory on resource-constrained ESP devices. While likely minor, it's a consideration for a platform that prioritizes efficiency.
* **"Good Enough" Transitions:** For many users, the existing transitions (where a new command simply overrides the old one) are "good enough" for their automation needs. The complexity of a "halt mid-transition" might not be seen as a universally necessary feature.

**5. Who Would Object and How to Convince Them:**

* **Core Developers/Maintainers:** Individuals like **OttoWinter, jesserockz, kbx81, and bdraco** (listed as maintainers for the Home Assistant ESPHome integration) would be key stakeholders. Their potential objections would likely stem from the technical hurdles (complexity, resource usage) and a desire to maintain the core design principles of simplicity and stability.
* **Users Prioritizing Stability/Simplicity:** Some users might prefer a more streamlined and predictable light behavior and might not see the value in adding such a complex feature, especially if it could introduce potential bugs or increase firmware size.

**How to Convince Them:**

* **Clear Use Cases:** Articulate compelling and common use cases where this feature significantly enhances user experience. Examples:
    * **Manual Override:** A user starts a slow dimming transition but then manually presses a physical button to immediately stop it at its current brightness for task lighting.
    * **Conditional Halting:** An automation dims a light over 30 seconds, but if a motion sensor detects presence, the dimming stops immediately at its current brightness, and the light holds there until motion ceases.
    * **Dynamic Scene Adjustments:** A scene transitions lights, but a subsequent, higher-priority event (e.g., a doorbell press) needs to instantly freeze the current light state without resetting it or immediately jumping to a new predefined state.
* **Technical Proposal:** If you're a developer or have technical expertise, propose a well-thought-out technical implementation that addresses the potential hurdles. This could involve:
    * Explaining how the intermediate state would be tracked efficiently.
    * Suggesting a clear API (e.g., a `light.hold_transition` action or a `hold_on_interrupt` parameter for `turn_on`/`turn_off`).
    * Demonstrating minimal impact on resources and overall system stability.
* **Community Support:** Gather support from other ESPHome users in the forums or on GitHub by discussing the need for this feature. A strong community interest can demonstrate its value.
* **Modular Implementation:** Propose it as an optional, modular feature that users can choose to include or exclude, minimizing impact on those who don't need it.

In summary, while ESPHome provides robust light control and transitions, the ability to halt a transition mid-way and retain the precise intermediate state isn't a natively supported or widely requested feature. Implementing it would require addressing state management complexity and potentially deviating from the current design philosophy, but with clear use cases and a solid technical proposal, it's certainly something that could be considered for future development.

You've hit on a critical point\! The "move/stop" modality for brightness and color control, as defined in Zigbee/Matter specifications, is indeed a compelling use case that ESPHome currently struggles with. The fact that it's a *standardized* interaction model within leading smart home protocols strengthens the argument significantly.

Let's break down how to create a compelling case for this feature and address potential objections.

### Compelling Case for "Move/Stop" Implementation in ESPHome

The core argument is that supporting "move/stop" directly within the ESPHome light component would:

1.  **Improve User Experience (UX) for Manual Control:**

      * **Intuitive and Natural:** Holding a button to dim/brighten and releasing it to stop is a highly intuitive and common interaction for physical light switches. Faking it with multiple taps (quantum increments) or rapid-fire `light.turn_on` commands is clunky and less satisfying for the user.
      * **Granular Control:** "Hold-and-release" allows for very precise brightness/color adjustments, letting the user stop exactly where they want, rather than being limited to predefined steps.
      * **Reduced Latency and Jitter:** When implemented directly on the ESP device, the response to the button hold/release will be immediate and smooth. Relying on Home Assistant automations or rapid MQTT messages to simulate this introduces network latency and potential jitter, leading to a less fluid experience.

2.  **Ensure Compliance and Interoperability with Smart Home Standards:**

      * **Zigbee/Matter Mandate:** As you correctly point out, "move/stop" is one of the primary brightness adjustment modalities in Zigbee and Matter. For ESPHome to truly be a first-class citizen in the smart home ecosystem and seamlessly integrate with Matter bridges or Zigbee2MQTT, it needs to be able to *natively* represent and respond to these commands.
      * **Future-Proofing:** As Matter gains traction, devices that don't conform to its fundamental interaction models will feel less integrated and provide a poorer experience within a Matter-centric home.

3.  **Simplify User Configurations:**

      * **Less Complex YAML:** Currently, achieving a "hold-and-release" effect requires complex YAML logic, often involving `globals`, `on_press` and `on_release` actions, `lambda` functions for calculations, and possibly even `intervals` to simulate continuous change. This is difficult for beginners and prone to errors.
      * **Abstracting Complexity:** A native "move/stop" action would abstract this complexity into a single, straightforward configuration option within the `light` component, making it much easier for users to implement this common behavior.

4.  **Reduce Load on Home Assistant/External Automations:**

      * **Local Control:** Pushing this logic down to the ESPHome device reduces the burden on the Home Assistant server or other external automation engines. The ESP device can handle the continuous dimming/brightening itself, only reporting the final state, rather than requiring constant commands from Home Assistant. This is a core tenet of ESPHome's local-first philosophy.

### Addressing Potential Objections and Convincing Maintainers

Maintainers are often concerned with:

  * **Increased Code Complexity/Maintenance Burden:** Adding new features always adds code.
  * **Resource Usage:** ESP devices have limited memory and CPU.
  * **Edge Cases/Bugs:** New features can introduce unforeseen issues.
  * **Niche Feature:** Is it worth the effort for a small segment of users?

Here's how to counter these:

1.  **Acknowledge and Propose Solutions for Complexity/Resource Usage:**

      * **Modular Design:** Emphasize that this could be an optional feature. Users who don't need "move/stop" wouldn't incur the overhead.
      * **Efficient Implementation:** Highlight that the underlying light component already handles transitions. The "halt" part essentially means setting the `target` to the `current_value` during a transition. The "move" part means continuously updating the `target` based on a ramp, and the "stop" means halting that ramp. This isn't entirely new, but rather an extension of existing transition logic.
      * **Leverage Existing Frameworks:** Discuss how it can build upon existing `light` component and `output` platform structures. For example, a `light.move` action could take `direction` (up/down/stop) and `speed` parameters, and `light.stop` would simply stop any active `light.move` operation.

2.  **Counter the "Niche Feature" Argument Directly:**

      * **Standardization:** This is the strongest point. It's *not* a niche feature; it's a fundamental interaction modality in the leading smart home protocols (Zigbee, Matter). If ESPHome aims to be a robust platform for smart home devices, supporting these standard interactions is crucial.
      * **Prevalence in Commercial Devices:** Many commercial smart dimmers and switches use this "hold-and-release" model. Users expect this behavior. ESPHome empowers DIYers to replicate commercial functionality.
      * **Frustration with Alternatives:** The current "faked" methods are a source of frustration and complexity for users, indicating a real need. Point to community discussions where users are trying to achieve this manually (e.g., the Reddit thread you found that mentions "not reliable to start dimming on press and stopping on release").

3.  **Provide Concrete API Suggestions:**

      * **New Light Actions:**
          * `light.move_brightness:`
              * `id:` (light ID)
              * `direction: [UP|DOWN|STOP]` (or `delta_per_second: <float>` for continuous change)
              * `speed: <percentage_per_second>` (optional, defaults to a sensible value)
          * `light.move_color_temperature:` (similar parameters)
          * `light.move_color:` (similar parameters, perhaps with hue/saturation delta or speed)
      * **Simplified `on_press`/`on_release` integration:**
          * Example YAML:
            ```yaml
            binary_sensor:
              - platform: gpio
                pin: GPIO12
                id: dimmer_up_button
                on_press:
                  then:
                    - light.move_brightness:
                        id: my_light
                        direction: UP
                        speed: 10%_per_second
                on_release:
                  then:
                    - light.move_brightness:
                        id: my_light
                        direction: STOP
            ```
            This is significantly cleaner than current methods.

4.  **Volunteer for Implementation (if possible):**

      * If you or someone else in the community is willing to tackle the development, it significantly lowers the barrier for maintainers to accept the feature. A well-crafted Pull Request (PR) with clear documentation and tests is the strongest argument.

By framing this as essential for ESPHome's position within the broader smart home ecosystem and demonstrating how it enhances user experience while providing a clear path for implementation, you can make a very strong case for the "move/stop" functionality. It moves beyond a "niche" request to a foundational feature for modern light control.

You're absolutely right to consider a combined campaign for ESPHome and Home Assistant! Given that Nabu Casa (the company behind Home Assistant) also directly supports ESPHome, a unified approach makes perfect sense. The "move/stop" modality isn't just about ESPHome devices; it's a fundamental aspect of how users interact with lights, especially those governed by Zigbee and Matter.

Currently, Home Assistant's core `light` component *doesn't* have a native "move/stop" service call. While it can trigger automations based on "hold" events from Zigbee or Matter remotes (which then *simulate* the dimming by sending rapid `light.turn_on` commands with incremental brightness), it doesn't expose a direct API for continuous, rate-based adjustment and a separate stop command.

Many users resort to complex automations, Node-RED flows, or even custom Python scripts within Home Assistant to try and replicate this behavior. As your search results confirm, discussions often revolve around workarounds like binding directly in Zigbee2MQTT (which offloads the "move/stop" logic to the Zigbee coordinator/device itself) or crafting intricate `repeat: while` automations. This indicates a clear gap in core functionality.

### Combined Compelling Case for ESPHome and Home Assistant

The combined argument is stronger because it highlights a systemic deficiency in how Home Assistant (and by extension, ESPHome as an integrated part of it) handles a common and standardized smart home interaction.

**Core Argument:** To be a truly mature, user-friendly, and interoperable smart home platform, Home Assistant and its integrated device firmware (like ESPHome) must natively support the "move/stop" light control modality as defined by Zigbee and Matter. This is not a niche feature but a fundamental interaction pattern expected by users and mandated by modern standards.

**Key Points for the Combined Case:**

1.  **User Experience Parity with Commercial Devices:**
    * **Intuitive Control:** The "hold-and-release" dimming experience is standard on many commercial smart light switches and remotes (e.g., IKEA, Lutron, Philips Hue). Home Assistant users, regardless of their hardware, expect this fluid, responsive control.
    * **Eliminate Janky Workarounds:** The current need for complex automations or rapid command sending leads to a sub-optimal, often jerky, and less reliable user experience due to network latency and event processing overhead.
    * **Accessibility:** For users with motor skill limitations, continuous dimming via hold-and-release can be significantly easier than precise multiple taps.

2.  **Standard Compliance and Ecosystem Integration:**
    * **Zigbee and Matter Mandate:** Reiterate that "move/stop" is a core part of the Level Control Cluster in Zigbee and Matter. For Home Assistant to properly manage and expose these devices (whether native Matter or Zigbee through ZHA/Z2M), it needs to understand and directly translate these commands.
    * **Simplified Matter/Zigbee Integration:** If Home Assistant's `light` domain supported `move` and `stop` actions, integrations like ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT, and Matter could directly map incoming `move`/`stop` cluster commands to these Home Assistant services, leading to cleaner, more efficient code within the integrations.

3.  **Performance and Efficiency:**
    * **Offloading Logic to Devices:** By implementing "move/stop" directly in ESPHome, the continuous brightness calculation and adjustment happen on the device itself. Home Assistant only needs to send a single "move up/down" command on button press and a "stop" command on button release. This drastically reduces network traffic and processing load on the Home Assistant server.
    * **Real-time Responsiveness:** Local execution on the ESP device ensures immediate and smooth light adjustments without the delays inherent in sending multiple commands over the network.
    * **Consistency Across Devices:** Whether it's an ESPHome device, a native Matter light, or a Zigbee light, a unified "move/stop" service in Home Assistant would allow for consistent automation and control logic.

4.  **Developer Experience and Maintainability:**
    * **Simpler Blueprints and Automations:** Imagine a Home Assistant blueprint for a button remote that simply calls `light.move_brightness` on `button_hold` and `light.stop_brightness` on `button_release`. This is vastly simpler and more robust than current solutions, reducing the support burden on maintainers and empowering more users.
    * **Reduced Integration Complexity:** Integrations dealing with Zigbee/Matter devices would have a direct, semantic way to expose and control light dimming, rather than having to translate "move/stop" into a series of `turn_on` commands.

### What Would Need to Be Done to Home Assistant to Support It Properly?

1.  **`light` Domain Service Calls:**
    * **New Service Calls:** Introduce new service calls within the `light` domain (e.g., `light.move_brightness`, `light.stop_brightness`, `light.move_color_temperature`, `light.stop_color_temperature`, etc.).
    * **Parameters for `move_brightness`:**
        * `entity_id` (or `area_id`, `device_id`)
        * `direction`: `up`, `down`
        * `speed`: (optional) A rate, e.g., `percentage_per_second` or `level_per_second`. This would allow slow, gentle fades or faster adjustments.
    * **Parameters for `stop_brightness`:**
        * `entity_id` (or `area_id`, `device_id`) - simple stop command.

2.  **Integration Layer Updates:**
    * **Core Light Platform:** The underlying `LightEntity` class (or its base `Light` platform) would need to define these capabilities.
    * **MQTT Light:** The MQTT Light integration would need to support these new `move`/`stop` commands, likely by publishing specific topics/payloads that ESPHome's MQTT light component could subscribe to.
    * **ZHA/Zigbee2MQTT:** These integrations would map the incoming Zigbee Level Control Cluster `Move` and `Stop` commands directly to the new Home Assistant `light.move_brightness` and `light.stop_brightness` service calls. This would be a significant improvement over their current internal handling.
    * **Matter:** The Matter integration would similarly map Matter's Level Control Cluster `Move` and `Stop` commands.

3.  **Frontend/UI Enhancements:**
    * While not strictly necessary for backend functionality, proper UI elements (e.g., in the developer tools, or potentially new card types) could expose these new service calls for testing and advanced users.

4.  **ESPHome Implementation:**
    * As discussed, ESPHome's `light` component would need to implement the actual logic to receive these "move/stop" commands (either via MQTT, native API, or directly through Matter/Zigbee if ESPHome gains direct Matter/Zigbee support) and translate them into a continuous, local brightness/color adjustment loop that can be halted instantly.

**Combined Call to Action:**

Present this as a strategic enhancement for the entire Home Assistant ecosystem. Frame it as:

* **Elevating the User Experience:** Delivering the fluid, intuitive control users expect from modern smart lighting.
* **Embracing Smart Home Standards:** Natively supporting core interaction models from Zigbee and Matter.
* **Optimizing Performance and Reliability:** Shifting continuous control logic to the device layer.
* **Simplifying Automation:** Reducing the need for complex, fragile workarounds.

This is a very strong case that aligns with Home Assistant's mission to be the most powerful and user-friendly smart home platform. The fact that Nabu Casa oversees both projects strengthens the argument for a synchronized effort.
