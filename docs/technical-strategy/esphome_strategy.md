# ESPHome Move/Stop Light Control Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document proposes implementing native "move/stop" light control functionality in ESPHome to align with Zigbee and Matter standards, improve user experience, and enable more intuitive manual light control
.
The move/stop modality—where users can initiate continuous brightness/color changes and halt them at any point—is a fundamental interaction pattern in modern smart home protocols that ESPHome currently lacks.

## Problem Statement

ESPHome's current light component supports transitions with fixed endpoints but lacks the ability to:

- Start continuous brightness/color adjustments without predetermined targets
- Halt ongoing transitions while preserving the current intermediate state
- Provide intuitive "hold-and-release" dimming functionality expected by users

This limitation forces users to implement complex workarounds using rapid-fire commands, resulting in poor user
experience and increased system overhead.

## Standards Compliance Gap

### Zigbee and Matter Requirements

The move/stop modality is mandated by leading smart home protocols:

- **Zigbee Level Control Cluster**: Defines `Move` and `Stop` commands as core functionality
- **Matter Level Control Cluster**: Implements identical move/stop semantics
- **Commercial Device Expectations**: Users expect ESPHome devices to behave like commercial smart switches that support
  hold-and-release dimming

### Current Workaround Limitations

Existing approaches to achieve move/stop functionality have significant drawbacks:

1. **Complex YAML Configurations**: Require intricate logic with globals, intervals, and lambda functions
2. **Network Overhead**: Multiple rapid commands create unnecessary traffic and latency
3. **Unreliable Behavior**: Timing-dependent workarounds are prone to edge cases and failures
4. **Poor User Experience**: Jerky, unresponsive dimming compared to commercial devices

## Technical Analysis

### Current ESPHome Architecture

The existing `LightState` class provides:

- `start_transition_()` for predetermined endpoint transitions
- `stop_effect_()` for halting light effects
- No mechanism for continuous adjustment or mid-transition halting

### Implementation Requirements

To support move/stop functionality, ESPHome needs:

1. **Enhanced State Tracking**: Monitor current interpolated values during transitions
2. **Continuous Update Loop**: Support ongoing brightness/color adjustments without fixed endpoints
3. **Immediate Halt Capability**: Stop transitions and preserve current state
4. **Hardware Abstraction**: Consistent behavior across PWM, addressable LEDs, and other light types

### Proposed API Design

````yaml
# New light actions
light.move_brightness:
  id: my_light
  direction: UP  # UP, DOWN, STOP
  speed: 10%_per_second  # optional rate control

light.move_color_temperature:
  id: my_light
  direction: WARMER  # WARMER, COOLER, STOP
  speed: 50K_per_second
```text

### Simplified User Configuration

Current complex workaround:

```yaml
# Current ESPHome implementation requires complex workaround
globals:
  - id: dimming_active
    type: bool
    initial_value: 'false'
  - id: dimming_direction
    type: int
    initial_value: '0'  # -1 = down, 0 = stop, 1 = up
  - id: current_brightness
    type: float
    initial_value: '0.0'
  - id: dimming_speed
    type: float
    initial_value: '0.05'  # 5% per step

interval:
  - interval: 100ms
    then:
      - if:
          condition:
            lambda: 'return id(dimming_active);'
          then:
            - lambda: |
                float new_brightness = id(current_brightness) + (id(dimming_direction) * id(dimming_speed));
                if (new_brightness > 1.0) new_brightness = 1.0;
                if (new_brightness < 0.0) new_brightness = 0.0;
                id(current_brightness) = new_brightness;
                auto call = id(my_light).turn_on();
                call.set_brightness(new_brightness);
                call.perform();

  - platform: gpio
    pin:
      number: GPIO12
      inverted: true
      mode:
        input: true
        pullup: true
    id: button_up
    on_press:
      - lambda: |
          id(dimming_active) = true;
          id(dimming_direction) = 1;
    on_release:
      - lambda: |
          id(dimming_active) = false;
          id(dimming_direction) = 0;

  - platform: gpio
    pin:
      number: GPIO13
      inverted: true
      mode:
        input: true
        pullup: true
    id: button_down
    on_press:
      - lambda: |
          id(dimming_active) = true;
          id(dimming_direction) = -1;
    on_release:
      - lambda: |
          id(dimming_active) = false;
          id(dimming_direction) = 0;

light:
  - platform: monochromatic
    output: pwm_output
    id: my_light
    on_turn_on:
      - lambda: |
          id(current_brightness) = id(my_light).current_values.get_brightness();

Proposed simple solution:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: gpio
    pin: GPIO12
    on_press:
      - light.move_brightness:
          id: my_light
          direction: UP
    on_release:
      - light.move_brightness:
          id: my_light
          direction: STOP
```text

## Business Case
