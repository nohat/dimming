This is an excellent idea for Home Assistant, as "press-and-hold" for dimming is a very common and intuitive interaction model for smart lighting, often found in commercial smart home systems. Enabling direct core command support would significantly improve the user experience for many.

Let's break down how we can estimate the potential number of individual users who would easily leverage this improved functionality:

**1. Home Assistant's User Base:**

* Home Assistant's analytics are opt-in, so the public numbers are an *underestimate* of the total user base.
* As of September 2023, there were over 250,000 active Home Assistant installations reported via analytics.
* However, statements during "State of the Open Home 2025" (a community event) suggested that the new estimates indicate **2 million active installations**, and that only about **a fourth (25%) of all Home Assistant users opt-in for analytics**. This implies a much larger actual user base.
* Therefore, we can reasonably assume the current active Home Assistant user base is in the range of **2 million users**.

**2. Identifying the Target Segment: Users with Dimmable Lights and Compatible Remotes:**

* **Dimmable Lights:** Smooth dimming functionality is only relevant to users who have dimmable lights. Given the prevalence of LED lighting and smart bulbs, a very high percentage of Home Assistant users likely have at least some dimmable lights.
    * The smart home market is growing rapidly, with lighting control being a significant segment. Reports indicate strong growth in smart lighting (e.g., global smart home market projected to reach USD 89.8 billion in 2025, with lighting control being a key component).
    * It's safe to assume **at least 80-90%** of Home Assistant users interested in lighting control would have dimmable lights. Let's use **85%** as a conservative estimate.
    * $2,000,000 \times 0.85 = 1,700,000$ users with dimmable lights.

* **Compatible Remotes/Buttons:** The "press-and-hold" functionality relies on remotes that send "button held down" and "button released" events. Many Zigbee and Z-Wave remotes, as well as some Wi-Fi buttons, support this.
    * Home Assistant users are typically "power users" and enthusiasts who invest in a variety of smart home hardware. Many actively seek out physical controls like remotes to complement their voice or app control.
    * It's challenging to get exact statistics on the percentage of Home Assistant users with such remotes. However, community discussions and existing blueprints (like the ones found in the search results that already try to achieve this functionality through scripts) indicate a strong desire and existing use of these types of remotes for dimming.
    * Let's estimate that **50-70%** of users with dimmable lights would either already have compatible remotes or would be very likely to acquire them to leverage this improved functionality. Let's use a mid-range estimate of **60%**.
    * $1,700,000 \times 0.60 = 1,020,000$ users who have dimmable lights and are likely to use compatible remotes.

**3. "Easily Leverage" - The Impact of Core Support:**

This is the key. Currently, achieving smooth press-and-hold dimming often requires complex automations, scripts, or blueprints (as indicated by the search results mentioning various community-driven solutions). Direct core command support would significantly simplify this.

* **Reduced Complexity:** A "start" and "stop" command in the `light` domain would be intuitive, requiring far less technical expertise than current workarounds. This would lower the barrier to entry considerably.
* **Improved Reliability:** Core support would likely be more robust and less prone to edge cases or breaking changes compared to custom scripts.
* **Discoverability:** Official commands would be well-documented and more easily discoverable within Home Assistant's UI and development tools.

Given these benefits, we can expect a high adoption rate among the identified target segment:

* **High Leverage Potential:** We can estimate that **80-90%** of the users identified in step 2 (those with dimmable lights and compatible remotes/willingness to get them) would "easily leverage" this functionality once it's directly supported in core commands. This is because the pain point (complex dimming control) is significant, and the solution is straightforward.
* Let's use an adoption rate of **85%** for this segment.
    * $1,020,000 \times 0.85 = 867,000$ potential users.

**Estimation Summary:**

1.  **Total Home Assistant Active Installations (Estimated):** 2,000,000
2.  **Users with Dimmable Lights:** 2,000,000 * 0.85 = 1,700,000
3.  **Users with Compatible Remotes (or likely to acquire):** 1,700,000 * 0.60 = 1,020,000
4.  **Users who would "Easily Leverage" core support:** 1,020,000 * 0.85 = **867,000 users**

**Conclusion:**

Based on these estimations, approximately **850,000 to 900,000 individual Home Assistant users** would be able to easily leverage smooth dimming functionality via "press-and-hold" remote buttons if direct "start"/"stop" commands are implemented in the Home Assistant light core. This represents a significant portion of the Home Assistant user base who are already invested in smart lighting and physical controls, and who would greatly benefit from this simplification and improvement in core functionality.
