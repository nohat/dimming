# Project Scope and User Impact Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the potential user impact of implementing native dynamic light control capabilities in Home Assistant, specifically focusing on press-and-hold dimming functionality and transition improvements
. The analysis estimates the number of users who would benefit from these enhancements.

## User Impact Estimation

### Home Assistant User Base Analysis

Current data on Home Assistant's user base indicates:

- **Analytics Limitations**: Home Assistant analytics are opt-in, resulting in underreported usage statistics
- **Reported Installations**: As of September 2023, over 250,000 active installations were reported via analytics
- **Estimated Total User Base**: Based on statements from "State of the Open Home 2025," current estimates suggest
  approximately 2 million active installations, with only 25% of users opting into analytics
- **Working Estimate**: 2,000,000 active Home Assistant installations

### Target User Segmentation

#### Users with Dimmable Lighting Infrastructure

**Market Context**: The smart lighting segment represents a significant portion of the smart home market, with strong adoption of LED lighting and smart bulbs among Home Assistant users.

**Estimation Methodology**:

- Home Assistant users typically implement comprehensive smart home systems where lighting control is fundamental
- LED lighting adoption is nearly universal in smart home installations
- Smart bulbs and dimmable switches are common entry points for Home Assistant users

**Conservative Estimate**: 85% of Home Assistant users have dimmable lighting infrastructure

- **Calculation**: 2,000,000 × 0.85 = 1,700,000 users

#### Users with Compatible Control Hardware

**Hardware Requirements**: Dynamic dimming functionality requires input devices capable of generating press-and-hold events, including:

- Zigbee and Z-Wave remotes with long-press support
- Smart switches with hold detection
- Matter/Thread devices with continuous input capabilities
- WiFi-based buttons with extended press functionality

**Adoption Analysis**:

- Home Assistant users demonstrate higher-than-average investment in diverse smart home hardware
- Physical controls remain popular despite voice and app alternatives, providing tactile feedback and guest
  accessibility
- Community discussions and existing automation blueprints indicate strong existing demand for hold-to-dim functionality

**Estimated Adoption**: 60% of users with dimmable lights either possess compatible hardware or would likely acquire it

- **Calculation**: 1,700,000 × 0.60 = 1,020,000 users

### Core Support Impact Assessment

#### Current Implementation Challenges

**Existing Solutions**: Users currently achieve hold-to-dim functionality through:

- Complex automation sequences
- Custom scripts and blueprints
- Third-party integrations (Node-RED, AppDaemon)
- Direct protocol commands (bypassing Home Assistant)

**Technical Barriers**:

- High complexity requiring advanced Home Assistant knowledge
- Reliability issues and edge cases
- Network flooding with rapid command sequences
- Maintenance burden with Home Assistant updates
- Limited discoverability of solutions

#### Benefits of Native Implementation

**Simplified User Experience**:

- Intuitive service calls within standard `light` domain
- Reduced technical expertise requirements
- Official documentation and support
- Integration with Home Assistant UI components

**Technical Improvements**:

- Enhanced reliability through core implementation
- Optimized network usage
- Consistent behavior across device types
- Future-proof compatibility

**Adoption Projection**: 85% of identified target users would utilize native functionality

- **Rationale**: Significant pain point resolution with straightforward solution
- **Calculation**: 1,020,000 × 0.85 = 867,000 users

## Summary

| Metric                             | Users       | Percentage |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Total Home Assistant Installations | 2,000,000   | 100%       |
| Users with Dimmable Lighting       | 1,700,000   | 85%        |
| Users with Compatible Hardware     | 1,020,000   | 51%        |
| **Projected Active Users**         | **867,000** | **43%**    |

## Project Impact

The implementation of native dynamic light control capabilities would directly benefit approximately **867,000 Home Assistant users** (43% of the total user base)
. This represents a substantial improvement in user experience for nearly half of all Home Assistant installations.

### Additional Benefits

Beyond the core user base analysis, this project would provide:

- **Accessibility Improvements**: Simplified setup benefits users with varying technical expertise levels
- **Professional Installation Support**: Enhanced capabilities for commercial Home Assistant deployments
- **Ecosystem Standardization**: Common interface encouraging hardware manufacturer adoption
- **Future Capability Foundation**: Framework for advanced lighting control features

The scope encompasses not only immediate user impact but establishes infrastructure for continued innovation in Home
Assistant's lighting control capabilities.
