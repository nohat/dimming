# Universal Smart Lighting Control Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Universal Smart Lighting Control project - a unified architecture for intuitive and performant dynamic lighting control in Home Assistant.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project proposes a fundamental enhancement to Home Assistant's lighting control, creating a unified system for smooth, intuitive dimming‚Äîlike turning a physical dimmer knob. It addresses long-standing user frustrations with choppy or unresponsive lights and introduces a "conductor" (a new core component) to orchestrate seamless brightness and color changes across all smart lights, regardless of brand or protocol.

## üìö Quick Start Guide

### New to this project?
1. **Start here**: [Core Architecture Proposal](architecture.md) - The main architectural document
2. **Understand the scope**: [Scope & Requirements](scope.md)
3. **See the big picture**: [Project Concepts](pro_concepts.md)

### Ready to dive deeper?
- **Technical Strategy**: Browse the [Technical Strategy](ha_strategy.md) section for implementation details
- **Integration Support**: Check [Integration Guides](top_lighting_integrations.md) for platform-specific information
- **Implementation Plans**: Review [Implementation](eng_execution.md) for execution details

## üîó Key Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Architecture Proposal](architecture.md) | Main technical proposal for universal lighting control |
| [Project Plan](project_plan.md) | High-level project timeline and milestones |
| [Home Assistant Strategy](ha_strategy.md) | Core Home Assistant integration approach |
| [ESPHome Proposal](esphome_proposal.md) | ESPHome-specific implementation strategy |
| [Capability Matrix](capability_matrix.md) | Device and protocol capability comparison |
| [Engineering Execution](eng_execution.md) | Detailed implementation roadmap |

## üöÄ Project Goals

- **Intuitive Control**: "Hold-to-dim, release-to-stop" as a first-class experience
- **Consistent Behavior**: Lights respond predictably across all integrations
- **Perceptually Uniform**: Natural-feeling light changes with appropriate dimming curves
- **Optimal Performance**: Minimal latency and network load using native device capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights

- New `dynamic_control` service parameter for continuous dimming
- Centralized `LightTransitionManager` in Home Assistant Core
- Native protocol support (Zigbee Move/Stop, Z-Wave Level Change)
- Optimized simulation for unsupported devices
- Real-time state feedback with `dynamic_state` attribute
