# MkDocs Auto TOC Plugin

This plugin automatically generates table of contents sections in your documentation.

## Usage

Add the marker `<!-- AUTO_TOC -->` in any markdown file where you want an automatic table of contents to be generated.

The plugin will replace this marker with a comprehensive table of contents based on your navigation structure.
