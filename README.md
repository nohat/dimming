### ÔøΩÔ∏è Documentation Validation

This project includes multiple layers of protection to prevent broken documentation:

```bash
# Install Git hooks (prevents committing broken docs)
make install-hooks

# Run comprehensive validation
./scripts/validate-docs.sh

# Install advanced pre-commit framework (optional)
make install-pre-commit
```

**Available validation tools:**
- **Git hooks** - Automatic validation before commits
- **Make targets** - Quick validation commands (`make docs-check`)
- **GitHub Actions** - CI validation on PRs and deployment
- **Pre-commit framework** - Advanced formatting and validation

See [`DOC_VALIDATION.md`](DOC_VALIDATION.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## üîÑ Automatic Deployment

This repository uses GitHub Actions for deployment:

- **PR Validation**: All pull requests are validated for documentation integrity
- **Automatic Deployment**: Clean builds are deployed to GitHub Pages from the main branch
- **Strict Mode**: All builds use `--strict` mode to catch warnings as errors
